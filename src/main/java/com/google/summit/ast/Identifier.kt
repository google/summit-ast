/**
 * An identifier, in standard AST parlance, is simply the name of some AST construct that has a
 * name, e.g. the name of a method or class. This information is captured in the [string] property,
 * which is, most often, the name as seen in the source code, but, in some circumstances, this may
 * be a synthetic string -- e.g. for "anonymous initialization block" elements, which, otherwise,
 * would have a blank string as an identifier.
 *
 * An advantage of representing Identifiers as separate objects is that it provides a place to
 * attach a source location. This can be useful for error reporting or for automatic fixes, when we
 * want to manipulate (for example) a variable name but not the entire declaration.
 *
 * A disadvantage of separate Identifier objects is the extra layer of indirection to query the name
 * of a symbol.
 *
 * @property string the identifier name
 * @param loc the location in the source file
